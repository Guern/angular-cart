##General Information

This program is built entirely in AngularJS and Bootstrap. It is meant to be a replacement for server-side shopping cart solutions while still being effective and efficient.

While there do exist other shopping cart solutions built in AngularJS, my goal is to eventually provide a fully customizable e-commerce platform that integrates with Stripe or Paypal (depending on administrator preference).

Please check out the source code at your convenience, or return to http://angular-cart.com for updated information.
